### 1.1 Propositions/Statements
A **proposition (or statement)** is a declarative sentence that is either true or false (but not both). The truth or falsehood of a proposition is called its **truth value.**

| Proposition                 | Truth Value |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| p= “The sea is blue”        | True        |
| q= “London is in Sri Lanka” | False       |
| r= “2 < 4”                  | True        |
| s= “4 = 7”                  | False       |
### 1.2 Connectives/Operators
**Connectives/operators** are used for making **compound propositions**.
