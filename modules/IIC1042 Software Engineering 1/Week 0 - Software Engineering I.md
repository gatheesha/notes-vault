Software Engineering – History
• First digital computers appeared in the early 1940s,
the instructions to make them operate were wired into
the machine.
• It was realized that this design was not flexible and
came up with the "stored program architecture“
(=stores program instructions in electronic memory)
or von Neumann architecture.
• Division between "hardware" and "software" began
with abstraction being used to deal with the complexity
of computing.
• Programming languages started to appear in the
1950s Ex. Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL
The term 'software engineering' was suggested at conferences
organized by NATO in 1968 and 1969 to discuss the 'software crisis'.
• The software crisis was the name given to the difficulties encountered
in developing large, complex systems in the 1960s.
• It was proposed that the adoption of an engineering approach to
software development would reduce the costs of software
development and lead to more reliable software.
• The term "software engineering", used first by Anthony Oettinger in
1967 and then used by Margaret Hamilton in 1968 as a title for the
world's first conference on software engineering, sponsored and
facilitated by NATO.

What is software?
Computer programs and associated
documentation. Software products
may be developed for a particular
customer or may be developed for a
general market.

What are the attributes of good software?
Good software should deliver the required
functionality and performance to the user
and should be maintainable, dependable
and usable.

Why software is important ?
• The economies of almost all nations are dependent on software
• Software engineering expenditure represents a significant
fraction of the Gross National Product (GNP) of developed
countries.
• More and more systems are software controlled
(transportation, medical, telecommunications,
industrial, entertainment, education etc.)
• eGovernance (eGov) has also emerged as a tool for delivering
government services, to citizens in a convenient, efficient and
transparent manner.
